# MoDWT
The modwt (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform) is a wavelet transform that allows for a redundant and stationary decomposition of a signal. The PyWavelets library in Python provides an implementation of the MODWT.

In this example, we generate a sample signal and then perform the MODWT using the pywt.modwt function from the PyWavelets library. The resulting coefficients are then plotted to visualize the decomposition at different levels.

Adjust the wavelet and level parameters according to your requirements. You can choose different wavelets and levels based on the characteristics of your signal.

Make sure to adapt the code to your specific use case and data. The PyWavelets documentation (https://pywavelets.readthedocs.io/) provides additional information on available wavelets and their properties.
