# MoDWT
The modwt (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform) is a wavelet transform that allows for a redundant and stationary decomposition of a signal.

In this example, I've replaced pywt.modwt with pywt.wavedec. The mode='per' argument is used to specify the periodic boundary extension mode commonly used in MODWT. Feel free to adjust the wavelet and other parameters based on your specific requirements.
